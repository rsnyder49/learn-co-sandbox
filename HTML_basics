#HTML consists of different elements. Each element consists of tags, which wrap around content. For example, say we wanted Hello World to appear as a paragraph. We could use the p element, which consists of an opening p tag and a closing p tag.
<p> Hello Wolrd </p>

#We can also alter any number of attributes inside of the opening tags. For example, the a element, which is used for links, has an href attribute to specify the destination address of the link. If we wanted to link to www.flatironschool.com, we could do so as follows:
<a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>

#We can also nest elements inside of each other. To have a link displayed as a separate paragraph, we could nest an a element inside of a p.
<p>This <a href="http://www.google.com">link</a> will be a part of a separate paragraph.</p>

#All HTML documents begin with a "doctype declaration" tag, which tells our web browser which version of HTML to use. HTML is a language that is currently evolving. Since it's not wrapping any content, our doctype declaration doesn't require a closing tag. To use HTML5, the current up-to-date version, we can simply declare
<!DOCTYPE html>

#Next, we add an opening and closing html tag. This tells the web browser to interpret everything inside the tags as HTML code.
<html>
 
</html>

#Every HTML page is made up of two primary sections: a head and a body. The head element contains metadata about the HTML document and other information for the browser, while the body element contains the actual content.


<html>
    <head>
        <!-- metadata about the HTML document as a whole -->
 
    </head>
 
    <body>
        <!-- content of our page will be here! -->
 
    </body>
</html>

#Let's also take a brief moment to recognize how to add comments into an HTML document. These won't get rendered to the browser at all: they're just helpful notes for the author.
<!-- NYC Pizza is world-famous, cheap, and loved by both vermin and human like! -->

#HTML gives us access to different header elements, ranging from h1 to h6, with h1 being the largest and h6 being the smallest.
<h1> Dogs!</h1>
<h3>Why Dogs are Great</h3>
 
<h6>Different Breeds</h6>

#In addition to changing how the text is displayed, search engines use headers to help determine what a web page is about. Remember, when we provide semantic markup, machines can infer the "main points" of a page. A well structured article will generally have its principle arguments bracketed by low-number header tags -- this very document does exactly that!

#We can embed images on our web pages using the img element. The img element doesn't have a closing tag. The src attribute tells the browser where to find the image. The alt attribute will be displayed if an image can't be loaded, and also describes the image to search engines.
#The alt tag presents a moment to talk about an important principle behind Tim Berners-Lee's vision for the Web: it is inclusive. If you're using assistive technologies because you have a sight impairment, it's helpful to know what's being displayed. If you're in a remote community where internet access is expensive, you might choose to disable images and only pay to download those which you absolutely need. So while an img will inject an image and "work," honoring the Web's vision for openness and inclusivity requires that we provide the alt tag as well.

<img src="URL_TO_IMAGE" alt="Picture of a Dog">

#Some other useful HTML elements are lists. We can make bulleted, or unordered lists, using opening and closing ul tags. Inside, we can nest an li, or "list item" element for each item on our list.
<h5>My Favorite Things in No Particular Order</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Vinyl Records</li>
    <li>Pickling</li>
</ul>

#We can also make a numbered, or ordered list, using an ol tag.
